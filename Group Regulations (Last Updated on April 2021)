### Group Regulations (Last Updated on April 2021)

A “Travel Provider” tag to announce events in Group Chat is required and delivered upon request and moderators approval. Requirements to get a tag are: a). SL Account must be at least 6 months old. b). If part of an Organization, applicants must be referred by the owner(s) of the Organization to certify they have completed training and have been active for at least one month.

Chit-chat is closed. Group chat is open exclusively to announce events.

Announce only specific and verifiable events involving travel in a vehicle (i.e.: jet flights, boat rides, bus rides, tours, etc).

Announcements shall not be used as a marketing technique. Mottos, group links, external links and ASCII typography are not allowed.

Timing between posts from different Users or Organizations is 0 minutes. Timing between posts from a same User or Organization is restricted to 15 minutes. Any attempt to disrupt Group interaction with Travelers will result in the airline losing their “Travel Provider” tag.

Keep announcements generic, simple and concise. Adjectives are not allowed in events descriptions. Your motto and ideas about tips and turning off AO’s are up to you at your location.

Last or final call announcements are not permitted.

Announce your flights only in Group Chat. Do not post flight announcements as a Group Notice under any circumstance.
